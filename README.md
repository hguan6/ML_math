The purpose of this project is to practice machine learning algorithms. 
The regression algorithms are build with basic python libraries: numpy, pandas, etc. SVM algorithm uses sklearn high level library, while I intend to rewrite it with liblinear and svmlib. The neural network is writen with tensorflow.
